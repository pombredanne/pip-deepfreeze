# pip-deepfreeze

A better pip freeze workflow for Python application developers.

## Installation

Using [pipx](https://pypi.org/project/pipx/) (recommended):

```console
pipx install pip-deepfreeze
```

Using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```console
pip install --user pip-deepfreeze
```

It is *not* recommended to install `pip-deepfreeze` in the same environment
as your application, so its dependencies do not interfere with your app.
